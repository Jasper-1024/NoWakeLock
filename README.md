# NoWakeLock

* This is English version(although a lot of google translationðŸ˜‚), for china user [ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ](https://github.com/Jasper-1024/NoWakeLock/blob/dev/README/README_zh_cn.md)

* An application that controls Android wakelocks can run on Android N and later.

* **Serious warning** This application is still in Alpha testing stage. I will not be responsible for any damage caused by the software to your device.

## About

* With the update of Android version, doze mode is enough to suppress the power consumption of the background of the application, but some advanced users still hope to be able to control the wakelock by themselves.

* Amplify is good enough to meet the needs of most people, but after Android N, Amplify stops updating.

* So NoWakeLock expects to achieve the same function as Amplify does on Android N and later.

## Features
